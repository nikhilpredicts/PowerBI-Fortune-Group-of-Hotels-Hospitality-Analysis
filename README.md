# Fortune Group of Hotels Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI

## Problem Statement:
- Fortune Group of Hotels owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been 
in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other 
competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Fortune Group of 
Hotels are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
- As a strategic move, the managing director of Fortune Group of Hotels wanted to 
incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and 
revenue.
